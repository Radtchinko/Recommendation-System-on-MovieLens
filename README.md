# Recommendation-System-on-MovieLens
In this repository we are going to introduce the reader to recommender systems. We will also build a simple recommender system in Python. The system is no where close to industry standards and is only meant as an introduction to recommender systems. We assume that the reader has prior experience with scientific packages such as pandas and numpy.
